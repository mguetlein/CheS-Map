# wizard : general ###################################

error.no-features = Clustering and embedding require compound features. You have no features selected.\n\
Please select features in step 3., or disable clustering and embedding.

# wizard : dataset ###################################

dataset.title = Load Dataset
dataset.desc = Select a dataset from your file system for clustering, embedding and visualization.
dataset.big-data.disable-question = Show compound structures:
dataset.big-data.enabled = No (\"big data mode\" enabled).
dataset.big-data.disabled = Yes (default).
dataset.big-data.not-enabled-warning = CheS-Mapper renders all compound structures simultaneously in 3D space. \
If the viewer lags or uses lots of memory on your machine when showing large datasets, \
try using the \"big data mode\" by disabling \"Show compound structures\".
dataset.big-data.enabled-warning = \"Big data mode\" is enabled. This renders only data points instead of compound structures in 3D space. \
Consequently, the viewer runs faster and uses less main memory when showing large datasets.

# wizard: build 3d ###################################

build3d.title = Create 3D Structures
build3d.desc = Compute 3D coordinates for all compounds in the dataset.
build3d.info.cached = 3D structures already built with {0} (result was cached, no time consuming re-computation needed).
build3d.warn.already-3d = 3D already available in dataset \"{0}\" (at least one z-coordinate is set), this will override the original 3D structures.
build3d.warn.3d-missing = 3D is NOT available in dataset \"{0}\" (all z-coordinates are 0). 2D flat structures are later shown in the viewer.
build3d.slow = Building 3D structures might take a while (up to a minute per compound). \
The result will be stored, so this computation is only performed once.
build3d.slow-and-not-needed = Building 3D structures is time-consuming and probably unnecessary, as \
only data points instead of compound structures are shown in 3D (\"big data mode\" enabled in the first wizard step).

# build 3d methods

build3d.no-3d = No 3D Structure Generation (use original or 2D structures)
build3d.no-3d.desc = Does NOT create 3D structures.\nUses the 2D/3D structural information from the dataset (if provided, e.g., in an SD-File). \
\nIf the dataset does not include 2D coordinates (e.g., in a SMILES file), the 2D structure layout is computed using {0}. 

build3d.cdk = CDK 3D Structure Generation
build3d.cdk.desc = Uses {0}\n\
The ModelBuilder3D supports 2 different forcefields.\n\
<b>Warning: </b>This model builder is much faster than the OpenBabel builder, but it tends to produce unreliable results.\n\n\

features.title = Extract Features
features.root = Features
features.desc = Features may already be included in the dataset, or they can be created with various algorithms. The selected features are used for the clustering and/or 3D embedding.
features.root.desc = The available features are shown in the left panel. Select a (or a group of) feature(s) and click \"Add feature\". \
The selected features - shown in the right panel - will be used for clustering and/or embedding.\n\n\
The clustering/embedding result relies on the selected features. For example, select structural features (e.g. OpenBabel Linear Fragments) \
to cluster structural similar compounds together and to place structural similar compounds close together in 3D space.\n\n\
Consider carefully how many/which feature/s to chose. Select only a handful of features to increase the influence of each \
single feature on the clustering and embedding. Selecting a larger number of features will effect the clustering and embedding result \
to represent "overall" similarity.
features.slow = Feature computation may take some time for some of the selected features. \
The computed feature values are cached, so you have to compute them only once for each dataset.
features.slowMining = Feature computation may take some time for some of the selected features. \
The computed feature values are cached, so you have to compute them only once for each dataset. \n\
Increase the minimum frequency when mining structural fragments takes too long.

features.struct.desc = Structural fragments represent sub-structures of compounds. \
The sub-structures are encoded as SMARTS strings (see: http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html). \
As a structural fragments can either "match" or "not match" a compound, each fragment is represented as a binary nominal feature (possible feature values: "match"/"no-match").

features.struct.mine = Mine Substructures
features.struct.mine.desc = The structural fragments are dynamically computed by searching the dataset compounds.

features.struct.match = Match SMARTS Lists
features.struct.match.desc = The structural fragments are computed by matching pre-defined lists of SMARTS strings.\n\
Copy a smarts.csv into the following folder to integrate any structural fragments: {0}\n\
Each line in the csv-file should have 2 values, name of the smarts string and the smarts string itself. \
(Optionally, a third value indicates the minimum number of matches, i.e. you can configure how often a smarts fragment should at least occur in each compound.) \
Comments (starting with "#") will be printed as description. Example csv file:\n\
"Benzene","c1ccccc1"\n\
"Carbonyl with Carbon","[CX3](=[OX1])C"

features.struct.cdk.desc = Always uses {0} (instead of OpenBabel).\n\
Matches a predefined set of {1} SMARTS patterns (see API link below).\n\
API: {2}

features.moss = MoSS - Molecular Substructure Miner 
features.moss.desc = MoSS - Molecular Substructure Miner ({0})\n\
http://www.borgelt.net/moss\n\
MoSS finds all closed frequent substructures, that is, all substructures that appear with a \
user-specified minimum frequency in the database (and do not have super-structures that occur \
with the same frequency).\n\
(Ignores the setting "matching software", neither OpenBabel nor CDK are used.) 

features.hashed = Hashed Fingerprints

cluster.warning.disjoint.desc = You are using a non-disjoint cluster algorithm, i.e. each compound can be assigned to \
more than one cluster.\n\
CheS-Mapper was designed for disjoint cluster algorithms, we apologize if any errors may occur.
									
# cluster methods

cluster.no-cluster = No Dataset Clustering
cluster.no-cluster.desc = No clustering is performed. This will embed all structures directly into 3D space without separating them into clusters. \
This is a valid option especially for smaller datasets (but can be used for any dataset size).

cluster.weka.cobweb.desc = Performs hierarchical conceptual clustering.\
It computes CU (category utility) of nodes in the hierarchical tree, in order to merge/split/insert nodes. Parameters:\n\
<b>acuity</b>: CU is computed based on the features standard deviations. Acuity defines a minimum value for the standard deviation. \
The lower acuity is, the more clusters will be created. (Only relevant for numeric features.)\n\

Similarity is computed according to the parameter <b>linkType</b> (see for possible types below).

cluster.weka.kmeans.desc = Assigns compounds to k randomly initialized centroids. \
Iteratively updates centroid positions and re-assignes compounds until the algorithm converges.\n\
<b>Limitation:</b> This method performs only one random initialisation. \
The cluster algorithm <i>{0}</i> should be preferred.

cluster.weka.farthest.desc = <i>k</i>-Means method with particular centroid initialization: It \
starts with a random data point (compound), and chooses the point furthest from it. Subsequently, the point that \
is furthest away from the already chosen points is selected until <i>k</i>points are obtained.\n\
<b>Limitation:</b> This method performs only one random initialization. \
The cluster algorithm <i>{0}</i> should be preferred.

cluster.weka.cascade = k-Means - Cascade
cluster.weka.cascade.desc = Runs simple <i>k</i>-Means algorithm for different sizes of <i>k</i>. The parameter <b>restarts</b> defines how \
many times k-Means is applied with different random intialization. Selects the best clustering result \
according to the Calinski-Harabasz criterion (see Calinski, T. and J. Harabasz. 1974. A dendrite method for cluster analysis. Commun. Stat. 3: 1-27.)

cluster.r.cascade-kmeans = k-Means - Cascade (R)
cluster.r.cascade-kmeans.desc = Uses {0}\n\

distance or similarity measure.

cluster.r.hierarchical = Hierarchical (R)
cluster.r.hierarchical.desc = Uses {0}\n\
Starts with each compound as a single cluster. Subsequently merges the two most similar clusters.\n\
Similarity is computed according to the parameter <b>method</b>: \"Ward's minimum variance method aims at finding compact, \
spherical clusters. The complete linkage method finds similar clusters. The single linkage method (which is closely \
related to the minimal spanning tree) adopts a "friends of friends" clustering strategy. The other methods can be \
regarded as aiming for clusters with characteristics somewhere between the single and complete link methods.\"\n\
Details: http://svitsrv25.epfl.ch/R-doc/library/GLAD/html/hclust.html

cluster.r.kmeans = k-Means (R)
cluster.r.kmeans.desc = Uses {0}\n\

embed.desc = Arranges the compounds in 3D space. The distance between compounds reflects their similarity according to the previously selected features.
embed.info.quality = The embedding quality measures how good the 3d-positions reflect the features values.\n\
It only depends on the feature values and the 3D embedding algorithm (i.e. not on clustering).\n\
In more detail: it determines the Pearson correlation coefficient between the Euclidean distance matrix based on the compound 3d positions, \
and the distance matrix based on compound feature values \
(using the same distance function that is used for the embedding method, Euclidean for PCA). \
The better the embedding, the closer the correlation coefficients to 1.\n\
The embedding quality describes the overall quality for the complete dataset. \
Select the "Embedding stress" property with the dropdown menu on the bottom left to get a embedding quality estimate for each single compound\n\
This warning is expected when using Random Embedding.\n\
If you get this warning and your are using PCA, try to use {0} instead.\n\
If you are using structural features, try to use {0} with similarity method "Tanimoto".\n\
If there are too many features with too diverse values, it may be impossible to get a good overall 3D embedding at all.  

# embed methods

embed.random = No 3D Embedding (Random positions)
embed.random.desc = The compound features are ignored. This compounds are arranged randomly, equally distributed in a sphere.

embed.weka.pca = PCA 3D Embedder (WEKA)

# wizard: align compounds ###################################

align.title = Align Compounds
align.desc = Adjusts the orientation of compounds in 3D space by aligning structurally similar compounds inside a cluster with each other.
align.error.no-struct = Requires structural features, no structural features selected!
align.warn.ignored-because-big-data = 3D alignment settings are ignored. \
Only data points instead of compound structures are shown in 3D (\"big data mode\" enabled in the first wizard step).

# align methods

align.no-align = No Cluster Aligner
align.no-align.desc = Does NOT align compounds. Hence, the compounds are oriented in 3D space as provided in the dataset

align.big-data-fake-align = Big Data Fake Aligner
align.big-data-fake-align.desc = ...

align.max-frag = Maximum Structural Fragment Aligner
align.max-frag.desc = Requires structural fragments as features. \
The compounds of each cluster are aligned according to their largest structural fragment that matches the complete cluster. \
Hence, their orientation in 3D space is adjusted such that the common substructure is superimposed.\n\n\
Depending on how the fragments have been created, the alignment uses the either the obfit command of {0}, or {1}.
align.max-frag.short = Maximum-Fragment

align.mcs = Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) Aligner
align.mcs.desc = First, the Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) of each cluster is computed. \
This is computationally intensive and will take quite long for large clusters (the runtime is O(n²)).\n\
Second the compounds of each cluster are aligned according to their MCS. \
Hence, their orientation in 3D space is adjusted such that the common substructure is superimposed.\n\n\
Uses {0}.
align.mcs.short = MCS
align.mcs.slow = MCS computation is a time consuming task. {0} should be preferred for medium-sized or large datasets (if structural fragments are available).

align.manual = Manual Subgraph Aligner
align.manual.desc = All Clusters are aligned according to a manual specified SMARTS.\n\
This is for expert users, that know the dataset very well.\n\
For the alignment, one of the following chemical libraries is used:\n* {0}\n* {1}.
align.manual.short = Manual Subgraph

# wizard : general

mapping.incomp-distances = Clustering and embedding use different distance measures
mapping.incomp-distances.desc = The clustering is based on \"{0}\" distance/similarity of compound feature values. \
However, the 3d embedding is based on \"{1}\" distance/similarity of compound feature values.\n\
You might want to use the equal distance measure for both approaches to achieve a more consistent clustering and embedding. \
This warning might as well be ignored.

mapping.align-ignored = 3D alignment settings are ignored. 
mapping.align-ignored.desc = Only data points instead of compound structures are shown in 3D (\"big data mode\" enabled in the first wizard step). \
Accordingly, no structures can be aligned. Hence, the selected 3D alignment algorithm (last wizard step) is ignored.

distance.err.bin-not-possible = Select a different distance/similarity measure. Binary measures only work for binary features (like, e.g., structural fragments).
distance.err.nom-not-possible = Select a different distance/similarity measure. Nominal measures only work for binary or nominal features (like, e.g., structural fragments).
distance.err.prefer-binary = Binary features have been selected in wizard step 3. A binary distance/similarity measure (like, e.g., Jaccard similarity) might be more suitable to compute the distance between two compounds.
distance.err.prefer-binary-frag = Structural fragments have been selected in wizard step 3. A binary distance/similarity measure (like, e.g., Jaccard similarity) might be more suitable to compute the distance between two compounds.
distance.desc = (Dis)similarity measures are used from R package proxy: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/proxy/index.html\n\
Similarity is converted to a distance measure with 1 - x.\n\
Measures with type binary are suited for structural fragments features.\n\
The variables of the formula for binary measures correspond to the number of fragments that \
match both compounds (a), \
match only one of the two compounds (b/c), \
or match both compounds (d).

# viewer

props.eq-pos = Equal 3D positions
props.eq-pos.desc = The position of {0} compounds is not unique; {1} position/s are multi-occupied.
eq-pos.warning = The {0} compounds have been mapped to only {1} distinct 3D positions
eq-pos.warning.details = The 3D position of {0} compounds is not unique; \
{1} position/s are occupied by multiple compounds.\n\
Embedding algorithms do assign 3D positions based on the feature values. \
If compounds have equal feature values, they will most likely be assigned equal positions in 3D space. \
To avoid this, add more features, that help to distinguish between compounds.\n\
This warning is expected if compounds occur multiple times in the dataset.\n\
Select the feature "Equal 3D positions" to inspect compounds have non-unique 3D positions.\n\
Use the "Spread" functionality to move compounds apart.

spread.warning = The "spread" functionality moves close compounds apart. \
Compound positions will reflect feature values less well.
spread.warning.details = Compounds with equal/very similar feature values are mapped to the same/very close positions in 3D space. \
Consequently, these compounds may overlap. \
The "spread" functionality moves compounds apart to better distinguish single compounds (also referred to as jittering). \
However, the compound positions change and therefore reflect feature value (dis-)similarity less well. \
To avoid this, you could instead try reducing the size of compounds. The difference between both methods is:\n\
Reducing the "size":\n\
* makes structures smaller and increases the space between them.\n\
* preserves compound positions.\n\
* does NOT separate compounds with equal positions.\n\
Increasing the "spread":\n\
* moves close compounds apart.\n\
* does NOT preserve compound positions.\n\
* separates compounds with equal positions.\n\
Another option could be to depict compounds as "Dots" (instead of, e.g., "Wireframe").

props.sali.detail = Activity cliffs are pairs of compounds with similar feature values but differing endpoint values.\n\
The pairwise SALI value is computed to identify if a compound pair forms an activity cliff.\n\
In CheS-Mapper, the pairwise value is transformed to a per-compound value by calculating the mean, \
maximum and standard-deviation of the SALI indices of each compound.\n\
For numeric endpoints, a change in activity of at least {0} must be given to compute SALI values\n\
(Otherwise, very similar compound pairs could get extreme high SALI values with only small differences in activity).
props.sali.identical-warning = {0} compounds have identical feature values but differing endpoint values (by > {2}).\n\
The {0} compounds form {1} tuples (or cliffs) with equal feature values.\n\
By definition, compound pairs with identical features but differing endpoints have an infinite high SALI value.\n\
Instead, a value >= {3} is assigned to these compounds (equal values are assigned for each tuple/cliff).
